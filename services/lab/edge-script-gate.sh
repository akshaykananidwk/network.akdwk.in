# Does upgrade-edge.sh tell the truth when it fails?

# It did not. Run early on a VPS where Go was installed from the official
# tarball — which unpacks to /usr/local/go/bin and is on nobody's PATH — it
# printed
#
#     ✗ go is not installed …
#     All steps passed.
#
# Two defects in four lines: it could not find a Go that was plainly there, and
# a failed preflight produced a PASS summary. The second is the false-pass
# class this whole project exists to find in other people's code, and it was in
# my own deployment script, on the first thing the operator ran.
#
# So every early exit is now exercised, and the assertion is the same for all
# of them: a run that did not finish must say FAIL and must exit non-zero.
#
#   ./services/lab/edge-script-gate.sh

# Needs root, for the mount namespace that hides Go from one of the cases. It
# changes nothing outside a temporary directory: the script under test stops at
# its own preflight in every case here, long before it would touch a binary,
# a service or the panel.
